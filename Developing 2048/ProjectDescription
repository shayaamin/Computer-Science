2048 is played on a grid of squares. Each square can either be empty, or contain a numbered tile.

The player chooses a direction (using the arrow keys) to tilt the board: north, south, east, or west. All tiles slide in that direction until there is no empty space left in the direction of motion.

As a tile slides, it can possibly merge with another tile with the same number. Each time two tiles merge to form a larger tile, the player earns the number of points on the new tile. This is implemented in Tasks 4-10.

One tile (with value 2 or 4) is randomly generated when the game begins. After each tilt, if the tilt did not change the board state, then no new tiles will be randomly generated. Otherwise, a single randomly generated tile will be added to the board on an empty square. 

The game ends when the current player has no available moves (no tilt can change the board), or a move forms a square containing 2048. This is implemented in Tasks 1-3.
